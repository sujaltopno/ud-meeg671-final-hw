A 2-degree of freedom robot manipulator has dynamics described by the following equation: B(q)  ̈q + C(q,  ̇q)  ̇q + G(q) = τ.
You are given a txt file (torques.txt) with n rows and 2 columns that represent torques (in N/m) commanded at the two joints of the robot at a frequency of 1kHz. Initial conditions of the angular positions and velocities are considered zero.

Matlab code is written that will simulate what the robot end-effector trajectory on the x − y plane will be. The code outputs a figure with the trajectory of the robot end-effector on the x and y axes.
